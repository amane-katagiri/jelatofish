        serves as a multiplier. Currently wave scale modifications can range from
        half length to double length. It would be fun to widen this sometime and

    I once attempted to make the coswave shift its scale over time, much like
    the spinflake generator does with its twist. I wasn't particularly succesful.
    But I did happen upon a *beautifully* bizarre twist to the generator which is
    really strange but not terribly useful. So I fire it once in every 64 generations
    or so, which is just infrequent enough that the viewer really goes "what the hell
    is THAT" when they see it.
    It's chaotic moirÂŽness, sorta - the wavescale increases by the exponent of the
    distance. At some point, the wavescale becomes less than one pixel, and then chaos
    begins to happen. Odd eddies show up, turbulences become visible, and a bit of static
    shines through here and there. It's quite beautiful in an abstract sort of way.
